# Prisma ORM Practice - Todos APIs

Note: This is just practice code, not a project.

## How to start:

- Step 1: Create .env and add the following:

```
DATABASE_URL="your_postgresql_connection_string"
```

- Step 2: Install & initialize packages

```
npm install
npx tsc --init
npx prisma init
```

- Step 3: Generate client

```
npx prisma generate
```

- Step 4: Once your new autogenerated client is ready, build your .ts files:

```
tsc -b
```

- Step 5: This will create a dist folder in your root directory, do the following to run the code:

```
node .\dist\insertUser.js
node .\dist\getUser.js
node .\dist\updateUser.js
node .\dist\createTodo.js
node .\dist\getTodos.js
node .\dist\getTodosAndUserDetails.js
```

NOTE: In any case you feel to change the schemas in the schema.prisma file in the prisma folder, you should update the db by migrating it and also re-generating a new prisma client.

```
npx prisma migrate dev --name somethingAdded
npx prisma generate
```

And the migrations can be tracked inside migrations folder inside prisma folder.
